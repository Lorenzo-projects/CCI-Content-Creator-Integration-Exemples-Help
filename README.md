# CCI-Content-Creator-Integration-Exemples-Help
This GitHub repository shares my simple setup for the Content Creator Integration (CCI) mod on Minecraft 1.20.1 (Forge 47.4.0), used on my Twitch channel . It’s designed to help streamers connect StreamElements events (follows, subs, donations, raids) to fun in-game actions like spawning mobs with viewers’ names. 🐑💀
